# CoronaMobile (Xamarin.Forms)

This application was created in terms of university summer internship. The project subject was Covid-19, so I decided to create a mobile application which can help patients with coronavirus infection to call a doctor at home, make an appointment for vaccination or call a nurse. The app was supposed to have a backend server but people who were making the server and database haven't finished API, so the application basically works locally only and most of the functionality is not implemented or locally hardcoded to imitate server behaviour. This project gave me some understanding of how to work with Xamarin.Forms.
